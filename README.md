<h1>CodeJam past problems solutions</h1>

<p>This git hub includes solutions I have come up with for some of the past Google code jam problems you can find the following items
note that the difficulty levels are based on my feeling as well as related to the number of points for the problem.<p>
<h4>2016 problems</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Counting Sheep - easy level
        <ul>
            <li>The problem is very straight forward with fairly simple solutions</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Revenge of the Pancakes - slightly intermediate
        <ul>
            <li>This is not difficult to solve the small dataset with a brute force solution. However the difficulty enters 
            intermediate due to needing a more efficient solution for the large dataset</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>JamCoins - intermediate / hard
        <ul>
            <li>The small dataset can be solved somewhat simply however the simple solution will usually result in long run times.
            This must be solved for the large dataset.</li>
            <li>This enters hard because the solution for the large dataset requires a strong understanding of what the problem is looking for.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h4>2015 problems</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Standing Ovation - Easy Level
        <ul>
            <li>Standard problem with a fairly standard algorithm</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Dijkstra - intermediate / hard</li>
        <ul>
            <li>The main difficulty of this problem is again fully understanding the problem and finding the simplest solution.</li>
            <li>NOTE: my current solution is unable to run the large dataset. Feel free to fork this repo and solve this one if you do please do a pull request</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Extra Info</h3>
<p>Note that these solutions are the ways I solved them. I give no guarantee that they are the best algorithm for solving the problem.
Most of the problems in the Google CodeJam will have multiple ways of solving the problem. Keep that in mind when looking over these solutions</p>

<h3>Pull Requests / Contributing</h3>
<p>If you are looking to add to your github profile by contributing to a repo this repo is open to have contributions and pull requsts made to it.
What will I accept for pull requests and how to submit them?</p>
<h4>What will I accept</h4>
<p>Alternate solutions: If you come up with your own solution to one of these problems either via a different language or a completely different
algorithm make sure to create a new folder "problemName-FirstLastname"</p>
<p>Improvement to existing solutions: if you improve an exisitng solution be sure to comment your improvements on the file then simply upload the pull request</p>
<p>Solutions to other problems: did you solve a different problem from the qualification round of a different year? Feel free to submit that in a folder: 
"problemName-FirstLastname"</p>
<p>Note: I'm not currently taking pull requests for round 1 level or higher problems. Also DO NOT submit any of the current CodeJam solutions until after the next round 
of the codejam is complete. Even then I would still be careful submitting your solutions depending on how google requests user code. You wouldn't 
want your code to be submitted by someone else as their code. I am unable to come up with a reason why someone would do this but better to play it safe.</p>
<p>I will not be uploading any of my CodeJam solutions until after I am out of the competition.</p>
